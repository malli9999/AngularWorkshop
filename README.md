3.The single page application are the which don't need to refresh all the time<br>

Coding part in Workshop <br>
I commented the coding part but it was in my Readme file
<!---
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.8/angular.min.js">

           </script>  
             <script src="app.js"></script>

       </Script>
    </head>
    <bod<y ng-app="myapp" ng-controller="myfirstcontroller">
        <h1>
            {{2+6}}
            </h1></t><input type="text" ng-model="test"/>
<h2>{{test}}</h2>
<h3>{{hello}}</h3>
<input type= "text"> 
    </body>
</html>


angular.module("myapp",[])
.controller("myfirstcontroller", ['$scope', function ($scope){
console.log("this is form controller")
$scope.hello= "Hello World";
}]);

-->
Finally it a good workshop and i learned something about Angular<br>
Dependency Injection: where we can use some other application in our application by injecting it into our apllication<br>
Single-Page-Apllication: we can develop the single page application using Angular where the application don't need to refresh all the time.
